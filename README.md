# DocuAnalyser

The project is an interactive web application that leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to provide users with text summarization and sentiment analysis functionalities. 

Built using **NLTK** for text preprocessing and sentiment evaluation, **Streamlit** for creating a user-friendly interface, and the **Transformers library** for advanced model capabilities, the app allows users to input text or upload documents. 

Upon submission, it generates concise summaries and analyzes the emotional tone of the content, categorizing it as positive, negative, or neutral.
